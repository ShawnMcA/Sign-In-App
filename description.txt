## Notes ## 
 -  Web app should connect to a VirtualBox linux VM running the backend
 -  Our Backend would be linux VirtualBox VM with webserver + database and 
    necessary editable web content
 -  Instructions should be included for backup of visitor logs and for web-content modification
 -  For VM, you can create a simple linux VM using Virtualbox. (virtualbox.org) - use the VM for your 
    development effort. The deliverable would be the VirtualBox VM with all the necessary services
    installed and configured along with the sudo use/other account information and instructions


UI considerations
 - Instead of 'Create account' it should be 'Register' for the button
 - A company logo should be added to the greeting page, and a smaller logo for other pages
 - The first box when registering should be for the name of the organization of the visitor
 - A 'Person here to see' box should be added
 - The purpose of visit should be a text box so user can see more than one line of what they type
 - This system is not online so there will be no way to 'upload a photo'- thus should just be 'take a photo' 
   button. This may even be after a visitor 'registers' there's the take photo page and then we go to the NDA
 - There should be a 'confirm information/back' page after 'register/create account'
